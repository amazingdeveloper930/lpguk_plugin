I have built a WordPress plugin from scratch that is designed to streamline the process of loading county lists from a database and registering domains for them. Additionally, this plugin is capable of loading fuel price data from an external SOAP server and configuring settings for children sites. By leveraging these features, users can more easily manage and optimize their web properties, improving their overall performance and usability. Overall, this plugin represents a powerful tool for developers and site owners who are looking to enhance their WordPress experience and achieve their online goals with greater ease and efficiency.
